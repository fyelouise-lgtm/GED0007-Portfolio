        <h2>Course Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong></strong> Taking GED0007 really shifted how I see photography. Before, I'd just grab my phone and take a picture of whatever seemed nice without putting much thought into it. Now I understand that there's actually intent behind every shot, like there's a reason you chose that angle or that moment. Learning about lines, patterns, and composition opened my eyes to details I used to ignore completely.</p>
        <p><strong></strong> The stuff we did in class helped me start looking at things differently. When we visited the art museum, I found myself picking up on leading lines, frames, and silhouettes without even planning to look for them. Random things like the texture of tree bark, cracks in the pavement, or how food sits on a plate suddenly seemed worth photographing because I could see the shapes and patterns in them. It hit me that photography has this way of making ordinary moments feel significant.</p>
        <p><strong></strong> This class didn't only improve my technical skills. It made me more creative overall. I actually enjoy taking photos now, mostly when I'm spending time with people I care about. It got me thinking more carefully about what I want to show and how to turn my emotions into something you can see. GED0007 made it clear that good photography isn't about expensive cameras or gear, It's about noticing what's already around you.</p>
